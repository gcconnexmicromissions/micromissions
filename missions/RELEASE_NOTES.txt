OVERVIEW:

This plugin adds a menu item to the left hand side menu on GCConnex.
This menu item leads the user to the missions front page where they can see a river of the most recently created missions or nothing if no missions have been posted yet.
On this page, there is a right hand side menu which the user can follow to the plugin's other pages.

Post opportunity will lead the user to a form. When they are done filling out that form and submit it they will have a second form to complete.
Once that form is complete and submitted they will have one final form to complete. 
Upon submission their mission will be created and they will be forwarded to a display of the mission information.
The design of these pages was guided by the given wireframes.

Search will give the user a single text input search field.
Upon submission, the missions title, type and description will be searched for the given input.

Advanced search will allow users to customize the search behavior by selecting a certain number of search parameters.
Upon selection, input fields will be generated accordingly.
Upon submission, the search will check the given parameters and use logic appropriate to each.

Browse latest will display the latest missions.
Searches will display missions in an abbreviated format.
Missions display design was guided by the given wireframes.

Posting an opportunity, clicking on the title link in the river or clicking the read more button from the search display will take the user to a display of the mission information.
From here, the user who created the mission may delete it.

In the administration panel and under settings, there is a Micro Missions page.

SOLUTIONS:

If the dropdown fields are not populated in any of the forms, go to the Micro Missions setting page in the administration panel and save the settings.

Micro Missions CSS is still a work in progress so a smaller screen (like a laptops) might have some display issues.
